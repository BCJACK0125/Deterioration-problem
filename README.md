• Consider a system that slowly deteriorates over time:
– When it is new it has a failure probability of 0.1
– the probability of failure increases every time unit linearly with 0.01
– Replacement costs are 1, after replacement the part is new

a) What is an appropriate state space? Argue why this satisfies the Markov
property
b) Compute the stationary distribution and use this to find the long-run
average replacement costs
c) Simulate the system for a long period and verify that you get
(approximately) the same answer
d) Solve the average-cost Poisson equation
e) Preventive replacement is possible at cost 0.6. What is the average
optimal policy? Solve it using:
  • policy iteration
  • value iteration
